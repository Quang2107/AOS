# Greeting

Hello everyone, i am **dtqdev**. I have a dream that make **Android phones** can run **IOS** only through **TWRP** (Team Win Recovery Project)

# What Is **AOS**

ðŸŒŸ | **AOS** is an **Android Rom** bring IOS style but it bases on **AOSP** (Android Open Source Project)

ðŸš€ | **AOS** Makes your phone smoother like **Apple Phones** and more features like **Freeze App When In Background** ; **Over Clock CPU** ; **Optimize GPU, CPU and RAM make your phone smoother**. And more features!

ðŸ“± | **AOS** Maybe supports all **Pixel Phones** in the future.

ðŸ”— | That's My First Repository About **Android Rom**. Hope to see you in the Beta Release!
